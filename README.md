Data：data_test.zip includes data for random problems (R), benchmark problems (mk, rdata and vdata) and complexity analysis experiments, while data_dec.zip includes data used for model evaluation.

Scheduling rules： Run the main.py file directly.

SHL：The model file stores the trained model parameters, so run the test.py file directly on the test set for inference. The requirements.txt file contains all software packages and their corresponding versions. Run the train.py file if you need the training process.

GA：Run the main.py file directly.
